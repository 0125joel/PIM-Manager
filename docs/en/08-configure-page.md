# Configure Page

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status: Planned Feature**
>
> The Configure page is not yet available in the application. This functionality is on the roadmap for a future release.
>
> PIM Manager is currently **read-only** and focused on visibility and reporting. Write capabilities (modifying PIM policies and creating assignments) will be added in a future update.

## Planned Functionality

The Configure page will allow administrators to:
- Bulk-modify PIM settings across multiple roles
- Apply consistent policy configurations
- Create role assignments at scale

For now, use the **Report** and **Dashboard** pages to view and analyze your current PIM configuration.

## Next Steps

- [Dashboard Page](./06-dashboard-page.md) - Visual overview and security insights
- [Report Page](./07-report-page.md) - Detailed role configuration view
- [Key Concepts](./05-key-concepts.md) - Understand PIM terminology
